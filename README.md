## Disclaimer
Parts of the design of the framework were inspired by the AlphaTwirl framework developed by Tai Sakuma [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/30841569.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/30841569). Some snippets, such as 
the progress bar and multi-threading were taken from older versions of the AlphaTwirl framework.
